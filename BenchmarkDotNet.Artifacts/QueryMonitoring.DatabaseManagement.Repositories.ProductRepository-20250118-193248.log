// Validating benchmarks:
//    * Assembly QueryMonitoring which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
If you want to debug the benchmarks, please see https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/guides/troubleshooting.html#debugging-benchmarks.

//    * Unable to create instance of ProductRepository, exception was: Cannot dynamically create an instance of type 'QueryMonitoring.DatabaseManagement.Repositories.ProductRepository'. Reason: No parameterless constructor defined.
